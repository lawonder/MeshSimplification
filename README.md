MeshSimplification
==============

Mesh Simplification algorithm by using vertex clustering

How to use
----------

###With UI
The load program of this version is complied on OS X 10.9. 

So try to run the program on OS X operating system.

###No UI
Usage: python main.py filename unit

"filename" is any files in original_mesh/ folder

"unit" is the length of the bounding box of the model

for example: python main.py cow.off 0.02
